Two ways we can do this


Approach 1: Reverse-proxy only
1. Maintain the requests in flight that have been sent to the server replica
2. Maintain the average response time from each of the server replica, discarding any outliers

Pros
1. All the heavy duty is on the server-side
2. Easy to implement
3. Doesn't rely on client

Cons
1. Doesn't consider whether the server replica is getting requests from other clients
2. Discarding probes logic is going to be different


Approach 2: Hybrid Approach
1. Calculate the response time for the request on the reverse-proxy
2. Get the requests in flight from the server replica


Pros
1. Also considers requests being handled from other clients
2. Response time is more uniform compared to others (Gives response time of server itself rather than an mean of requests)

Cons
1. Need to modify the server replica with a middleware
2. Complexity increases
