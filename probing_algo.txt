max_probes = 16

when to make probe requests to replica:
	1. when a requests arrives at the reverse proxy
	2. when the server has been idle for a certain time

how to decide the replicas to probe:
	1. select a number of replicas at random without replacement
	2. the number of replicas to probe is decided by a constant r_probe which can be less than 1 (there is a specific formula) (ex. 5.7, randomly perform ceil or floor each time)

how to decide which probes to discard:
	1. allow reuse of probes a certain amount of time (decided by a constant, r_probe and a r_remove value, maximum pool size, and number of replicas) see paper for formula
	2. when new probe arrives, and we are at max probes, we drop the oldest probe
	3. periodically remove the worst probe from the pool
	4. remove probes after they have remained for a certain time
